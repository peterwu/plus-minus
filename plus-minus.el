;;; Commentary:

;; This package implements plus-minus operations on binary, octal, hexical,
;; decimal digits as well as datetime.

;; It is designed with extensibility in mind and new patterns can be
;; later added.

;; It works like C-a/C-x in Vim, i.e. searches for number up to end of line
;; and then increments or decrements based on context

;; Install:

;; (use-package plus-minus
;;   :ensure t
;;   :bind (("C-c C-a" . +/-:plus-forward)
;;	    ("C-c C-x" . +/-:minus-forward)
;;	    ("C-c M-a" . +/-:plus-backward)
;;	    ("C-c M-x" . +/-:minus-backward)))

;; It supports forward and backward searches and  allows for increments
;; other than the default one.
;; For example, with the above key binding:
;; `C-u 5 C-c C-aâ€™ will let you increment by 5
